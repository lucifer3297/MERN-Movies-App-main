# MERN Movies App



## Overview

The MERN Movies App is a full-stack web application designed for movie enthusiasts to explore, search, and manage movie data. Built using the powerful MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, the application demonstrates seamless integration between the frontend and backend while ensuring high performance and a user-friendly experience.

This project showcases practical implementation of modern web development practices and provides a platform for users to interact with a dynamic and responsive movie database. The app can be extended further to include features like user authentication, personalized recommendations, and real-time updates.

## Technical Overview

### Architecture

The application follows the traditional MERN stack architecture:

1. **Frontend**: React.js handles the user interface and communicates with the backend via API calls.
2. **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js serve as the backend framework, providing endpoints for frontend requests.
3. **Database**: MongoDB stores movie-related data, including title, description, and other metadata.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /movies**: Fetch all movies from the database.
- **GET /movies/:id**: Fetch a specific movie by its ID.
- **POST /movies**: Add a new movie (admin-only feature).
- **PUT /movies/:id**: Update an existing movie's details (admin-only feature).
- **DELETE /movies/:id**: Delete a movie (admin-only feature).

### Tools and Libraries Used

- **React.js** for frontend development
- **Express.js** for backend APIs
- **MongoDB** for database
- **Mongoose** for database modeling
- **Axios** for API communication
- **Postman** for API testing
